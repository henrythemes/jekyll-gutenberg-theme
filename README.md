## What's Gutenberg?

Gutenberg is a web typography starter kit by [Matej Latin](http://matejlatin.co.uk).

> Gutenberg is a flexible and simple–to–use web typography starter
> kit for web designers and developers. It's a small step towards a better typography on the web.
> Beautiful typographic styles can be made by setting base type size,
> line-height (leading) and measure (max-width).
>
> Gutenberg sets the baseline grid to establish a proper vertical rhythm
> and makes sure all elements fit into it. It sets up the macro typography
> so you can focus on the micro–typographic details.
